# JADE_SPACE

JADE_SPACE provides an art-oriented space for artists and art appreciators.
Users will be able to upload artwork, build networks, and potentially facilitate bartering/selling of art-related goods. Users share and curate contact information at their own discretion to take advantage of JADE_SPACE.

It is built on node.js for the backend and jquery on the front end.
